# React tutorial

A public repo for Klárka, Jolanka and Míra.
These were the basic materials to show them the basics of React, like what is JSX (tsx), how they can create different React components, how to style them, how to use basic hooks, and even how to install useful packages to deepen their development.

## Installing Visual Studio code

- Visual Studio code is a code editor we will be using. It allows us to **edit code**, **use terminal** and **use github** from one place. Basically it is all we need in one place.

Install: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

## How to open Command prompt

## Installing Node Version Manager (NVM) and Node Package Manager (NPM)

- We will use NVM to mage our Node version.
- NPM is very usefull for installing node packages and other things (like React itself)

Install **NVM**: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases (Windows)

Install **NPM**: (Type in Command prompt)
```
nvm install lts
nvm use lts
```

After installing, check the version:
```
npm --version
```
Output should say: 8.15.0 (for example)

## Creating a new React app

- The simplest and most effective method to create a new React app is using a Create React App.

```
npx create-react-app **name-of-the-react-app** --template typescript
```

Start the React app:

```
cd **name-of-the-react-app**
npm start
```

- More info about Create React App: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started

## Actual coding part

- start by changing some bits of code in *App.tsx*.

## Useful shortcuts

- Saving the file and hot reloading the code: **ctrl + s**
- Formating the code to make it look really nice: **alt + shift + f** (I think)
- Turning of the React app: **ctrl + c**

## Using React hooks

- "React hooks" is the most useful thing in React and their knowledge is the must have. Here are the docs for them: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html or watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNhaISOUy6Q

**Here is a cheat code for some of the most usefull ones:**

- useState:

```
const [num, setNum] = useState<number>(0)
```

- useEffect:

```
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("num has changed")
}, [num])
```

# Code under this section is autogenerated by the Create React App command:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
